A typical User Experience Scenario in Smart Classroom:

The following is a typical user-experience scenario happened within the Smart Classroom. Multiple persons enter the room through the door.
At the door, there is an audiovisual identification module identifying the entering person’s identity through facial and voice identification.
If the person is identified as lecturer, he is granted the control right of the Smart Classroom. Besides, he takes a badge embedded with location sensor. 
The visual motion-track module tracks the lecturer’s motion in the room. Once he steps into the teaching area, he will be able to use gesture and voice command to exploit the Smart Classroom to give lessons.
Persons in the Smart Classroom other than lecturer are deemed as local students. When the lecturer is in the teaching area, he can start the class by just saying, “Now let’s start our class.”
